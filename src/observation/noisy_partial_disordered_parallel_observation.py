    """The Noisy Partial Observability Token, with possibly Disordered and Parallel Actions.

    The noisy partial observability token with disordered and parallel actions stores the step where some of the values of
    the fluents in the step's state are incorrect (noisy) or unknown (partial). In addition, the action stored also may or may not be
    disordered with an action in another parallel action set. Finally, a "parallel action set ID" is stored which indicates
    which parallel action set the token is a part of. Inherits the NoisyPartialObservation token class.
